Overview ((Overview: This section provides a high-level introduction to the project, explaining its purpose and what it achieves.))
The CodeDocumentationGenerator is a Python tool that automatically generates documentation for Python code files. It parses the code to extract class and function definitions, parameter types, and docstrings, producing organized Markdown documentation. This tool simplifies the process of documenting codebases, saving developers time and ensuring consistency across projects.

Features ((Features: A list of the primary functionalities the tool provides.))
Parses Python code to extract class and method definitions.
Automatically documents function parameters, including optional placeholders for missing descriptions.
Detects and displays type annotations, if present.
Saves the generated documentation as a Markdown file.
Usage ((Usage: Instructions on how to use the tool, including prerequisites and example commands.))
Install Dependencies: This project requires Python 3. No additional libraries are necessary as it uses Pythonâ€™s built-in ast module.
Run the CodeDocumentationGenerator:
Place the CodeDocumentationGenerator script and the target Python file (e.g., example_script.py) in the same directory.
Run the tool from the command line, specifying the target file:
bash

python code-parsing.py
Generated Documentation:
The documentation will be saved as DOCUMENTATION.md in the same directory.
Example ((Example: Demonstrates the tool's output with a simple code example and corresponding documentation.))
Suppose you have a Python file named example_script.py containing a ShoppingCart class. When you run the CodeDocumentationGenerator, it will generate a structured DOCUMENTATION.md file with details for each class and function, such as parameters and return types.

Code Structure ((Code Structure: Description of the main components and methods in the tool.))
The tool is organized into the following primary components:

Class CodeDocumentationGenerator: Manages the entire documentation generation process, including reading the target file and saving the output.
Method __init__(): Initializes the generator with the file path of the target code.
Method generate(): Parses the code, extracts classes, and methods, and compiles the documentation.
Method _parse_tree(): Parses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the code to locate class and method definitions.
Method _document_class(): Documents each class, including its description and methods.
Method _document_function(): Documents each function within a class, detailing parameters and return types.
Method _generate_placeholder_description(): Provides placeholder descriptions for commonly named parameters when none are available.
Method _get_annotation(): Extracts type annotations, if present.
Method save_to_file(): Saves the generated documentation to a Markdown file.
